This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classifaction model from a heterogenous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch.
Our goal is to a achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated
on benchmark data sets. We further consnider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive active learning and 
traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that... We conclude that...

<p class ="ex1"> <pre>
Stealth technology was first developed and used in 1977 where Lockheed Martin’s Skunks Work division was able to create an aircraft which was virtually undetectable to radars; 
this being the F-117A. The most notable stealth aircraft is the B-2 Bomber which was first introduced in 1988 and is still being used for surveillance and other uses to this day.
The components of an aircraft which can cause it to fly under the radar are as follows: The shaping of the aircraft’s chassis, Radar absorbing materials, Active Cancellation, 
Infared Stealth, Plasma Devices

  <h3 id="shaping-of-aircraft-chassis">Shaping of the aircrafts chassis</h3>
<pre>
 The main variable which is to be minimised by the shaping is the radar cross section, this being the area of the aircraft visible to the radar. The RCS (radar cross section) is the 
 measure of a target's ability to reflect radar signals in the direction of the radar receiver (Nicolaescu, L. and Oroian, T. (2001) Radar cross section. In: Proceedings of the 5th 
 International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Service (TELSIKS 2001). Niš, Yugoslavia, 19–21 September. pp. 65–68). One way this can be 
 utilized is by having smooth surfaces, as if cavities in the chassis were present the radar is able to detect it via the diffraction of the radio waves. Some other major components 
 which affect the radar cross section would be the cockpit but as in the F-117A and the B2-Bomber, a low-profile canopy is used; the canopy windows are sloped to scatter the radio waves
 away from their direction. ( Aronstein, D.C. and Piccirillo, A.C., 1997. Have Blue and the F-117A: Evolution of the Stealth Fighter. Washington, DC: American Institute of Aeronautics 
 and Astronautics.) The elimination of a rudder and an elevator prevent the creation of a retro reflector when in use, therefore absorbing most of the radio waves and not emitting them 
 to prevent the aircraft from appearing on a radar.

<h3 id="radar-absorbing-material-ram">Radar absorbing material (RAM)</h3>
<pre>
  Radar absorbing material are used to reduce the radar cross section, causing it to appear smaller on a radar. This material contains properties which absorb and conduct incident radar waves. A way of which this material is applied to the aircraft is via bonding or a spray-painting process.( Jha, B.K. and Aswale, M.S. (2016) ‘Mechanical aspects in stealth technology: review’, International Journal of Engineering and Technical Research (IJETR), 4(4), pp. 1–4). Most RAM contain a dielectric; some examples being carbon or magnetic ferrites (iron), these are formed into a plastic. RAM was first developed by Lockheed Martin and used in the A-12 and SR-71.( Dranidis, D.V. (2003) ‘Airborne stealth in a nutshell – Part I’, Waypoint, April/May. Available at: https://img.bemil.chosun.com/nbrd/data/10040/upfile/201001/20100106104428.pdf (Accessed: 20 October 2025).) The RAM works by converting the electromagnetic energy from the radar into heat energy, this is done via electric and magnetic losses within the material. The RAM is designed to work at specific frequencies, therefore multiple layers of RAM are used to cover a wider range of frequencies. ( Jha, B.K. and Aswale, M.S. (2016) ‘Mechanical aspects in stealth technology: review’, International Journal of Engineering and Technical Research (IJETR), 4(4), pp. 1–4).

 <h3 id="Active Cancellation System">Active Cancellation System</h3>
 <pre>
Active Cancellation is a method used to produce a artificial radiation field, containing the same amplitude and frequency but is in opposite phase from the radar’s target field; leading to the radar to receive an identical field without the trace of the target (aircraft) (Xu, S. and Xu, Y. (2014). Research on active cancelation stealth technique. Optik, 125(20), pp.6219–6222. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2014.06.144.(Accessed :20 October 2025)). This method is still in the research phase and has not been implemented into any aircraft to date. The main issue with this method is the time delay between the radar signal being received and the cancellation signal being transmitted; if this delay is too long then the radar will be able to detect the aircraft. (Xu, S. and Xu, Y. (2014). Research on active cancelation stealth technique. Optik, 125(20), pp.6219–6222. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2014.06.144.(Accessed :20 October 2025)).

   <h3 id="Infrared Stealth">Infrared Stealth</h3>
<pre>
  All objects known to man which release heat produce thermal radiation. This thermal radiation causes the atoms and electrons in the world to get excited and ionised which leads to the creation of electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic waves are made up of visible light, infrared radiation and microwaves. Infrared radiation have a wavelength of 0.76-1000 μm. Infrared sensors and cameras can be used to see objects which may be invisible to the naked eye. To prevent an aircraft from being spotted they are coated in a ‘Infrared stealth coating’ (Zhou, Y., Rather, L.J., Yu, K., Yang, M., Lu, M. and Li, Q. (2024) ‘Research progress and recent advances in development and applications of infrared stealth materials: A comprehensive review’, Laser & Photonics Reviews, 18(12), p. 2400530. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1002/lpor.202400530 (Accessed: 20 October 2025) which is made of a carbon-based conductive film on a foam like foundation which provides conductivity which allows for the absorption of multiple of infrared waves at different frequencies.( Liu, Y., Zhao, G. and Han, G. (2025) Carbon-based conductive film-based ultralight wide-angle absorbing metamaterial with full-frequency absorption within 2–18 GHz and preparation method thereof. United States Patent Application US20250237786A1. Published 24 July. North University of China). By reducing the emissivity of an aircraft, the surface temperature needs to also be regulated to achieve ‘infrared stealth’, (Kang, M., Wang, X., Wei, Y., Yu, Z. and Liu, Z. (2024) ‘Latest research progress of infrared stealth textiles’, Infrared Physics & Technology, 139, 105313. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infrared.2024.105313 (Accessed: 20 October 2025) this is due to Boltzmann’s law which tells us that “the relationship between the emitted power P of the thermal radiation of a blackbody object and the object’s temperature T is P=CT^a where C is a constant(Wellons, M., 2007. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Wooster Physics. [online] Available at: https://physics.wooster.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Junior-IS-Thesis-Web_2007_Wellons.pdf [Accessed 20 October 2025].
